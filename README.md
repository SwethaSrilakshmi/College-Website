# College Website

In sophomore year, as part of our hobby project, proposed & designed a website to extend functionalities of our existing college website. Developed features like separate student profile, resume building and alumni quora.

This web site makes the users feel comfortable to retrieve information quickly and directly. The student portal, faculty portal and alumnae quora are the extended features of this web site.

Students can easily access their academic information. They have an option of building their resume. Whenever they attend/partipate in any event, they can update the information in their resume building page. It automatically generates resume based on the information given by student.Students can also post their job/career related queries in almuni discussion forum and any alumnus can clarify those doubts.

Faculty can upload attendance and students academic information.
